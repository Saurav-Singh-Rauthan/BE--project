## Problem Statement :

Considering the various e-commerce websites, when a user purchases a product and wants to write the review for the product the experience isnâ€™t hassle free. So the main idea behind the project is to generate automatic feedback for the product when the user provides an video feedback or text feedback which then will be used for extraction of feedback summary.

## Motivation :

Whenever we purchase a product from an e-commerce website we have to through a long and not so interesting process of filling various forms and checkboxes. So why not automate this process where we simply have to record a video of reviewing the product and the feedback is automatically generated from it with a short keywords summary. Also, we can provide a text review which can be used to provide feedback in form of rating.
